# Hair_Salon_Software_System
Developed a user-friendly hair salon management system focused on simplifying appointment booking and client care. Implemented the backend using Java with JDBC for database connectivity and SQL 
for managing appointment and client data. Communication between client and server was handled via socket programming, enabling efficient real-time updates. 
The frontend was built using the Java Swing library, providing a responsive and desktop-friendly user interface.
